Since the instructions are the same in a capture process, in order to speed up, we can process and cache the instructions in advance, and directly replace the instructions with the processed instructions when using model reasoning.
The instructions we processed are stored in [data_parsing.pkl](https://github.com/Necolizer/RM-PRT/new/main/RT-LP).
