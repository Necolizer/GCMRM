[[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11335) [[Website]](https://necolizer.github.io/RM-PRT/).

**RM-PRT** is a Robotic Manipulation with Progressive Reasoning Tasks benchmark based on a realistic robotic manipulation simulator. Specifically, the RM-PRT benchmark builds a new high-fidelity digital twin scene based on Unreal Engine 5, which includes 782 categories, 2023 objects, and 15K natural language instructions generated by ChatGPT for a detailed evaluation of robot manipulation.
